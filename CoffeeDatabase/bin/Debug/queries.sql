JOIN film AS fil 
   ON inv.film_id = fil.film_id 
GROUP BY ren.rental_date,
         fil.title
ORDER BY rental_month,

SELECT ren.rental_date AS rental_month, 
       fil.title,
       ren.rental_id
FROM rental AS ren 
JOIN inventory AS inv 
   ON ren.inventory_id = inv.inventory_id 
JOIN film AS fil
